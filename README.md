# sainOCaml
This is a reimplementation of the [Sain and Puffering](https://github.com/eXodiquas/sainandpuffering) Terminal Code Jam by [togglebit](https://github.com/togglebyte) entry, but in OCaml. This implementation also does not feature a dictionary because it was pretty restrictive to just handle one language and to be honest, the ~1500 words in the dictionary were not that good to make a fun experience. If you want to know why this exists, just read the introduction in the linked repository.

## Installation

Run `ocamlopt -o sain sain.ml` while being in the same directory as the sain.ml file. After compiling a 'sain' file should drop out and you can run the program by either piping text into it or by running it and writing whatever you want and pressing RETURN to send your input through the Pain and Suffering machinery.
